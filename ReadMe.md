# Topaz Double — a double-height recreation of Amiga’s iconic Topaz typeface

This is an Amiga-native recreation of one of the most beautiful and readable 8×8 pixel typefaces ever created: Topaz, now rendered in pixel-perfect 8×16px.

Out of the box, Amiga used a tall (1:2) resolution — 640×200 (NTSC) or 640×256 (PAL) -- which means that the standard Topaz typeface/font would be half-height if you were using it with resolutions with a pixel aspect ratio closer to 1:1.

For some reason, there has never been an Amiga-native version of a double-height Topaz for use with resolutions with a square (1:1) pixel ratio. This project addresses this need.

This typeface is ideal for "modern" resolutions like 800×600, 1024×768, classic Amiga resolutions like 640×400 and 640×512 (Hi-Res Interlace) -- as well as 16:9 resolutions like 720p and 1080p, which are supported by the MiSTer FPGA Amiga core and RTG graphics implementations.

Two typefaces are included:

* Topaz Double Sans -- A double-height recreation of the Topaz variant used in AmigaOS 2 and 3.
* Topaz Double Serif -- A double-height recreation of the Topaz variant used in AmigaOS 1.2 and 1.3.

The typeface was lovingly recreated by hand, since there are no obvious ways to easily scale an Amiga font file to be twice the height.
